# lispcpp
A basic Scheme interpreter implemented using C++ (C++17) 

The code is based on the implementation by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) and inspired by the work from [Anthony Hay](http://howtowriteaprogram.blogspot.com/2010/11/lisp-interpreter-in-90-lines-of-c.html).

This project strted as a simple scheme interpreter to be embeded on a different program. However, at the end resulted in a interested way to learn and practice elements from "modern" C++.
